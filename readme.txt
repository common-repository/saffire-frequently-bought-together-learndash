Frequently Bought Together for LearnDash is a plugin that allows you to display a section that shows courses most usually bought together with the course listing watched by customers.

== Description ==

Frequently Bought Together for LearnDash is a plugin that allows you to display a section that shows courses most usually bought together with the course listing watched by customers.

**Bundle Courses without Creating Duplicate Listings**
By default, LearnDash allows you to create course bundles but if you have several course bundles to offer then it creates multiple duplicate listings which you don't want. This plugin allows you to select and  bundle courses on a course page, displays it on that course page and enables buyers to buy the bundled courses on a single click without creating multiple duplicate listings on your LearnDash site.

**Boosts Visibility and thus Sales of your courses**
Since the Frequently Bought Together (FBT) widget is displayed on the course page, it enables buyers to explore other courses that are related to the course they are watching on the site. Thus increasing visibility and sales of your store.

**Quick Set Up**
FBT widget can be set easily from the LearnDash course page.  You just select the courses you want to offer together,  hit save and voila it's done!


**Features**

Allows you to <strong>Bundle Multiple Courses</strong> on a single click of button from the course page.
Allows you to <strong>Show Enrollment Count</strong> for each of the courses in the FBT widget.
<strong>Easy to use interface</strong> to quickly set up the FBT widget.
